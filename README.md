Alright I think I've got i!  
When I make two different branches from main, then commit one...
The branch that wasn't commited will conflict!
Probably because it's an edit of a readme that no longer exists.
Git realizes this and says, "hey! the file that this branch is an edit of changed while you were editing, that's not ok!"

readme-edit-reloaded (Branch attempt 5)
In this path I've walked, I have gotten rid of my own footsteps!
There is nothing here mentioning the original tutorial I followed!
Oh dang, I guess there is now.
Let's Experiment!
Let's figure this stuff out!

readme-edit-rebooted (Branch attempt 4)
Below is a mess of two edits of the original readme!
Now I'm looking to recreate the scenario from last time.
I must understand merge conflicts! >=0

I followed the tutorial and am trying something else
Let's make two pull requests to the main, at the same time.
We'll see how it looks, and if it blows up! (It totally won't, nothing will happen)
I followed the tutorial, and am still messing around.  
Looks like in my last edit I branched from the branch, instead of branching from main.
We must see two ideologies clash, in this safe environment.
Then we will be prepared for the worst when it comes. >:|
Practice makes perfect! :)
