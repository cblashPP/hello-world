Below is a mess of two edits of the original readme!
Now I'm looking to recreate the scenario from last time.
I must understand merge conflicts! >=0

I followed the tutorial and am trying something else
Let's make two pull requests to the main, at the same time.
We'll see how it looks, and if it blows up! (It totally won't, nothing will happen)
I followed the tutorial, and am still messing around.  
Looks like in my last edit I branched from the branch, instead of branching from main.
We must see two ideologies clash, in this safe environment.
Then we will be prepared for the worst when it comes. >:|
Practice makes perfect! :)
